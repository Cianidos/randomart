# Random Art generator

Inspired by <https://github.com/tsoding/randomart>

Now it's a one-evening implementation.

A further optimized version will be added.
Also, shader generation, live update GUI with Time parameter will be added.

## Quick start

Open 'build/' dirrectory.

First build:

```console
clang++ -Wall -std=c++17 build.cpp -o build
```

Further run with simple:

```console
./build
```

## Examples 

Chosen ppm format is raw, images are large, and GitHub doesnâ€™t know how to render it.

Download and check it yourself.
